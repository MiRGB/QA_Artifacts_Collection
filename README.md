I am a software testing specialist with experience in test case design, execution, and bug reporting. I am proficient in designing test cases using TestLink, reporting bugs in JIRA and Trello, and documenting defects with ShareX. I have experience in API testing with Postman and performance testing using JMeter to assess system load and identify bottlenecks.

I am skilled in SQL for querying databases, as well as HTML and CSS for testing web application functionality and design. Additionally, I have experience with JavaScript, and can write automation scripts in Cypress and WebdriverIO to streamline web application testing.

With these skills, I contribute to ensuring high product quality and identifying issues early in the development process.
